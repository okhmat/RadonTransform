# Radon Transform
Implementation of Radon transform in naive way and using Fourier slice theorem.
Comparison these two approaches with other implementation of the "black-box" build-in function in Python scikit-image library. Also comparison of the efficiency and perfomance for different numbers of the information recording angles.
